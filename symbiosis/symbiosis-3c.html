  Symbiosis
  <br>
  Kenneth Lee
</div>
<div class="first">
  I sit with my thermos of coffee on the mall:<br>
  a mile-long promenade, arcades of elms  <br>
  flanking a generous aliquot of benches.  <br>
</div>
<div class="second">
  But at this early hour it starts to dawn:  <br>
  I am the only one without a dog.  <br>
  So, a witness to an ancient symbiosis,  <br>
  as it's evolved within a modern city:  <br>
</div>
<div class="third">
  The dogs, I note, are smaller, the owners  <br>
  less ferocious. The former sniff then poop,  <br>
  the latter, like potty-training parents, pat their heads,  <br>
  gather it in plastic doggy-bags.  <br>
</div>
<div class="fourth">
  It's no longer for the hunt or for protection;  <br>
  both species have adapted to survive  <br>
  hard loneliness inside a small apartment.
</div>
